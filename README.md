### What is this project for? 🥞

This project was made to appreciate my homeland through food!
Corny (but true!) stuff aside, It's great for people who are unfamiliar with our cuisine.
Altough it's still in the works, it is intended to be a very interactive and entertaining website for everyone.

### Current challenges? 🦐

SVGs :(

### Where's the data from? 🥙

The data is comming from my API, refer to this again https://github.com/AleksandarH/recipe-api.
The data inside of the API was mostly googled through Croatian culinary websites.

### Is it done? 🦑

Not nearly.
